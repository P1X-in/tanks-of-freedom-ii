# Map editor

Map editor is a tool that allows users to create skirmish maps. These maps can also be repackaged into campaigns.

Most basic editor controls are explained in the game settings, and can be overlayed as well.

Tile selector in the lower-right shows which tile will be placed. There is a number of categories, with many tiles in each. Most tiles require a ground tile to be placed first. Some tile categories will replace each other when placed, as things like Terrain, Building or Unit can not share the same tile.

Minimap in the lower-left allows users to see how the map is shaping up. There is a current cursor position indicator right above the minimap.

## Map Settings

Map Settings panel is available from the menu. It allows users access to more specific map configuration, as well as Trigger and Story editors for cutscenes, special behaviours and probably more.

It is divided in three tabs.

### Map Settings tab

This tab contains some map settings that are useful for both skirmish and campaign maps.

- `Skip initial camera pan to HQ` - this setting allows you to skip the inital camera pan to HQ (duh) regardless of the global flag in game Settings. This is useful when you want to open a scenario with a cutscene that leaves the camera in a specific spot.

- `Initial camera position` - camera position when the map is loaded. Can be picked manually with a picker button. This is useful when you want to open a scenario with a cutscene without revealing the area of the map where camera spawns as default (middle of the map)

- `Track` - musical track that is going to play during a match on this map. By default the track is randomised.

- `Allow Level up` - wether or not units are allowed to level up on this map. Can be used to create classic ToF 1-style maps.

### Triggers tab

Triggers can be set up to react to what is happening on the game board in order to start Stories (configured in Stories tab). New Trigger can be created by providing a name.

List of Triggers can be paged.

#### Shared properties

All triggers share some basic properties:

- `Delete` - this button, placed next to a Trigger name, will remove the trigger entirely. WARNING: there will be no confirmation.

- `Change` - this button, placed next to a Trigger type, allows for the type to be changed. If a new type is chosen, that is different from the previous type, some specific Trigger settings might be lost

- `Select` - this button, placed next to a Story name (empty if not set), allows for the linked Story to be selected from a list.
