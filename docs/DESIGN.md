# Tanks of Freedom 3-D Design Document

## Project Description

This document describes the details for a classic, turn-baset strategy game, that is a successor to *Tanks of Freedom*. It is meant to play very similarly to it's predecessor, while introducing 3D graphics, new story, new characters, and deepening the game mechanics it introduced.

Certain level of backwards compatibility is meant to be preserved. This new game should be able to import ToF online shared maps. It is not expected to be able to share maps, that original ToF could use. Online cross-play between ToF and this game is considered, but is not a part of core requirements.

Working title for the game is Tanks of Freedom 3-D, it is a subject to change, most likely based on it's story.

*Final title of the game is _Tanks of Freedom II_*

Proposed titles:
- *Tanks of Freedom - Liberum Gentem*
- _*Tanks of Freedom 2* (chosen title)_
- *Tanks of Freedom 2: Grim War*
- *Tanks of Freedom 2: Heroes*


## World
A fictional world of Libre populated by humans. It houses a big landmass called Dike Continent. Amber Noon is situated in a central place suitable for trade routes and with a lot of resources. It borders with Sapphire Dawn, Jade Twilight and Ruby Dusk.

### Theme

The game is about rivalry and silly political plots. None of the factions are purely good or bad. It focuses on interactions between characters from all nations.

Story has to decieve the player into thinking, that certain factions and characters are bad, and then subvert their expectations.


## Story Progression

Amber Noon Warlord Grim has imprisoned the King and started a war with Ruby Dusk. Betting on their rivalry, he asks Sapphire Dawn for help, telling them, that Ruby Dusk attacked first.

Ruby Dusk responds to provocation, and invades Amber Noon. Sapphire Dawn comes to help and attacks Ruby Dusk.

## Gameplay

### Goals

Overall goal of the game is to get through all of the campaign missions, and witness the story of the four warring nations.

In a single mission, goals are determined by the story. A win might be considered by reaching one of the many possible objectives (alternative paths) or require multiple to be achieved within single mission.
A list of possible win conditions:
- Capturing enemy HQ
- Surviving set amount of turns
- Capturing designated building(s)
- Destroying designated unit(s)
- Reaching designated area with (optionally specific) units
- Building up set amount of resources

### User Skills

- Click and drag with a mouse
- Use WSAD keyboard
- (OR) Use XBox-style gamepad
- Manage resources
- Strategize according to objectives
- Make tactical combat decisions
- Assess usefulness of different units
- Assess value of buildings
- Read on-screen messages

### Game Mechanics

This game is a turn-based strategy, where one player commands his/her forces fully, and the turn ends when all posible actions are exhausted, or player decides to pass the turn. Up to 4 players can play in a single match.

Game is played on a board consisting of square tiles, populated with terrain, units, buildings and obstacles. Player is awarded a resource at the beggining of the turn, which can be spent on new units or active skills.
Each unit can be moved, attack enemy units, activate special abilities or defend a position. All actions need to be contextual and easy to execute with two buttons. Unit actions are limited by the amount of it's own action points and other attributes.
Buildings can be neutral, or belong to one of the players. Player can ocuppy a building, that does not belong to them in order to capture it. Buildings can fulfill one or more of roles: provide resources, enable deployment of new units, or be a strategic objective.

There will be no Fog of War, that was present in the previous game.
There will be no dedicated battle screen, with combat taking place direclty on the main board.

Combat may cause collateral damage to the buildings and terrain around them. Damage is cosmetic only.

Resources gained from buildings will be taxed according to the amount of units deployed, to prevent unit spam.

### Progression and challange

Campaign will offer progression in form of gradual unlocking of new buildings and abilities. This will also be true for the AI opponents, to match the challange. In custom games, map creator will be able to decide which units, buildings and abilities are available.
Story progresses by in-game dialog, in-game on-board cutscenes.

In a match, progression will be possible by capturing more buildings, gathering more resources and recruiting more units.
Units will be able to gain XP and level up, which will result in them gaining minor stat boosts and unlocking abilities.

Difficulty can be adjusted by the player by choosing one of three possible difficulty levels. These will affect how many resources AI has. Difficulty can be selected on per-AI basis.
In PvP matches, there is no difficulty setting.

### Losing

There is no way of loosing a campaign, as each of the missions can be re-played as many times as player wishes (or needs).
A loss might be considered by failing to fullfill one of the many possible objectives (alternative paths) or require multiple to fail within single mission.
A list of possible loss conditions:
- Loosing player HQ
- Failing to complete objectives within set amount of turns
- Loosing designated building(s)
- Loosing designated unit(s)
- Enemy reaching designated area with (optionally specific) units

## Online features

### Map sharing

Once a custom map is created and verified (player won on it) it can be shared online via ToF Server. Server is a separate application in a different repository.

#### Map preparation

Once the map is done in the editor, it will be marked as unverified. Any verified map will be marked as unverified when it is modified. Player needs to win a skirmish match on this map in order for this map to be viable for upload. When map is saved, it's version iterator is incremented.

#### Map upload

In order to upload a map, an appropriate option from the Online menu must be selected. Then, a map from the list is picked. If a map has already been uploaded, it will not be uploaded again. This is verified by checking if the map metadata contains an online map id.

Once a map is selected, it will be uploaded to a server endpoint, and it will return a new map id, that will be stored with the map. The map is then also added to the list of online enabled maps.

Online map id will consistent of a randomly generated code and the maps iterator. If a map with pre-existing id is uploaded, it's code will be re-used with new iterator value. This will help with map continuity

#### Map download

In order to download a map, an appropriate option from the Online menu must be selected. Then, a list of latest or most downloaded maps can be seen and paged. Game client should download more pages as the player goes futher down the list. Once map is selected, it can be downloaded.

Map can also be downloaded by manually inputting a map id.

If that particular map already exists, it is not downloaded.

## Music and Sounds

Music should have chiptune style (though other styles are acceptable) with military march-style regular tempo.

Performing actions, such as unit movement and combat, should be accompanied by simple sound effects.

Initially, sounds from original ToF will be re-used, with possibility of new tracks being added.

Reduz has some interesting tracks on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/reduz) - he migth be willing to share them under a CC license.


## Technical Description

Game will be made in an open-source GodotEngine in 3D. It should consider future upgrade to Godot 4.0 and Vulkan renderer.

Godot provides easy export for Windows and Linux platforms. OSX is still available out of the box, but is not initially onsidered due to Apple's anti-consumer policies and possible difficulties in distribution and maintenance. Android is not considered due to potential low performance and not suitable controls.

Switch port could happen in the future, if the project reaches sufficient quality.

Project will be managed using Trello board: [https://trello.com/b/RQOwyCwm/tanks-of-freedom-3-d](https://trello.com/b/RQOwyCwm/tanks-of-freedom-3-d)
Trello might be swapped for an open-source alternative if it's transition into more commercialized product interferes with the project.

Github repository will be used to store code and assets publicly.

### Storyteller

Storyteller is a module, that allows for in-game scripting of missions. It consists of _triggers_ and _actions_.

#### Triggers
- start of turn X
- unit (player X) enters one of listed regions
- unit X enters one of listed regions
- player X has Y units (of type Z)
- player X controls Y of listed buildings
- all units for player X are destroyed
- unit X is destroyed
- unit X is being attacked
- player X has Y AP points

Considerations:
- one-off triggers are properly saved/loaded
- make stories play in cpu turn without breaking stuff

#### Actions
- message is displayed
- lock/unlock hud
- move/zoom camera
- move unit
- player X wins
- terrain element is added
- terrain element is removed
- unit is spawned
- unit is attacked
- building is claimed
- unit X is destroyed
- unit X is despawned
- building is damaged
- trigger is enabled/disabled
- give X AP
- take X AP

## Marketing

Make the project visible in GodotEngine community. Original ToF used to be quite popular, so maybe some of that popularity can be restored.

Game will be officially distributed on itch.io.

Once the project is properly bootstrapped, so there is some more flashy things to show, a development vlog could be a good option.

### Demographics

Game is primarly targeted at fans of turn-based strategies, so most likely male players around 30 year old. Colorful and cartoony graphics might attract younger crowd, but there are no simplifications planned to make the game kid-friendly.

### Platforms

ToF is targeting Windows and Linux, with posibility of OSX, Android and Switch being added. Being an open source project, game can be picked up and ported to many platforms by third-parties.

### Monetization

None

### Localization

Game will be provided in English and Polish, with possibility of more languages being contributed by community.
Considering the genre popularity in Japan, a translation might be worthwile.

### Licensing

ToF3D is a MIT-licensed software. Separate licenses for other software used in development may apply. Separate licenses for assets may apply. Please see LICENSE file for details.


## Other Features

Following original ToF release, a custom level editor, online map sharing and online multiplayer will be added as optional milestones.
Partial compatibility with original ToF might help, allowing to use the wealth of already existing maps.
