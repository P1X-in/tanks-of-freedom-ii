## Indie Turn Based Strategy in Isometric Voxel Art

A classic, turn-based strategy game with up to four armies fighting against each other. Challenge yourself in a campaign against AI, or a hot-seat battle with a friend. Using the easy map editor you can create any imaginable scenario to play -and share online for others to discover-!

ToF II follows in the footsteps of the original [Tanks of Freedom](https://github.com/w84death/Tanks-of-Freedom)

Each voxel model was handcrafted in gorgeous, 32 colour pallete. Sound effects were made on real GameBoy hardware. The game is open-source and runs smoothly thanks to Godot Engine.
